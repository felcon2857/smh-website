    testimony:
      "I had fears of Mom being confined due to the high rate of Covid infection in Bacolod. Again, Mom's specialist gave us a really good alternative/solution: Balay Atipan. Mom was put under 'hospital home care' through Balay Atipan and was stricly monitored (3x a day Blood sugar check, BP, etc). Her IV antibiotic was continuously administered for 5 days. There were nurse shifts at home. Balay Atipan went out of its way to help us and really care for mom at home in Bacolod. (it was an end-to-end care service. Medicine procurement, supplies, nurses to check on mom, blood tests, doctor's home visit, teleconsult, etc).",
